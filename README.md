Final personal project for graduation of Codaisseur Academy: create a full-stack app for selling and buying tickets online. Users must be able to add events, tickets and comments, and view those of others that posted.


This is a full-stack Javascript application bootstrapped with create-react-app utilizing React/Redux front-end, running on a Koa server with TypeORM in the back-end. For the (minimal) styling Material UI was used.



yarn install && yarn start from /client to start the app

yarn install to install dependencies in /server

tsc (on global tsc install) to compile ts into js in /server

node .  start to start server in /server folder
